	<p>Metal Gear Solid is a stealth game series described as "tactical espionage action." The main concept of the game is to avoid detection by your enemies by any means necessary instead of facing them head-on, otherwise known as stealth. This allows for interesting and unique game mechanics that force you to use your environment and think outside the box. The first game that includes Big Boss, released for the Playstation 2, is about a secret agent that goes by the code name 'Naked Snake.' He is tasked to eliminate soviet forces in Vietnam, but his task force and boss betray him and he is left in the wilderness to die. At the end of the game Snake eliminates his former allies and begins to construct an army of his own, Fox Hound.</p>
